// The function takes three arguments. The function will add three numbers.

// The function will return something since the return keyword is issued.

// Variables have been declared and assigned to values.

// Function is called with three numbers - not with the variables created - and then its value is stored in the var result.

// I expect the variable result to hold a value of 3, since the code will first add the 2 numbers and then add to the 3rd number. =3.
