A function is a callable piece of code that can take multiple inputs and return a single output. 
Functions always start w/ the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, following that are function parameters. These are external pieces
of data that the function will expect when you call it later on. The code that appears between the curly braces is called the function's body, or the block.
The keyword `return` is used to end the function and give back a single value result.
